# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode solutions! This repository contains my personal solutions to various problems on LeetCode. The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a reference and a learning tool for myself and others who are interested in improving their problem-solving skills in the field of computer science.

## Repository Structure

Each solution in this repository is organized by its difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) and then by problem number. Each problem has its own directory which contains the solution code and a README file with the problem statement and my approach to solving it.

## Usage

Each directory contains a solution file and a README. The solution file is named `solution.extension` where 'extension' is the appropriate file extension for the programming language used (e.g., `.py` for Python, `.cpp` for C++). The README file contains the problem statement and a brief explanation of my approach to solving the problem.
